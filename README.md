# 3DMP
 A repo containing my projects for the 3D Modeling and Printing facultative course

Check the .stl files for neat previews directly in github!!!

Each model's folder contains:
- the fusion 360 project file
- the stl file
- an image of the sliced model

Timeline:

           8/4 edit - added separate stl files for each chess piece, fixed a problem in the fusion project of the chessboard (the pieces                         were not colored differently, now they are), added an image of the sliced pieces where some are laying down because                         prusa slicer was displaying some errors which were fixed by changing the orientation like this
